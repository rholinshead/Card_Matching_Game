Card_Matching_Game
==================

A simple card-matching game made with Java. 

Credit / Thanks goes to Mr. Picheca for helping with the setup and completion of this project. 

Please note this is my very first repository on GitHub and therefore any techniques that come with experience are 
bound to be missing (sorry).

This card-matching game was made in about 3 days and is one of my favourite projects made with Java, using the Netbeans
IDE. 

Feel free to use the code for your own intentions, whether it be to learn or criticize. Feel free to fix any issues with
the code and get back to me to let me know what you think.
